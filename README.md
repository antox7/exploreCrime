## JS Project

I am currently deciding to choose one of the following topics that I have in mind: 

### (1) 
Illustrate the relationship between Crime level
and Income per capita, Unemployment rate, and Education. (Time Series)

I have worked with crime stats before so the data is available at borough level for NYC. 

### (2) 
Time series analysis between Obesity and Fast Food Stores and Income per capita.

I have to take a look at the data for Fast Food stores. This one is interesting but I am not quite sure if the data is available in a format that would be useful (i.e. whether data is annual, etc)

### (3)
This one is freestyling but I was thinking about a web app that has basic i/o. 
input: food item
output: nutritional props/cons

The ability to compare several foods and be able
to pick the one with less harmful content.

But I think the overall idea, visually, could be 
less 'fancy' and therefore not alluring in terms of styling.

### (4)
This one is also kind of freestyling and moving away from data visualization but the general idea: 

input: Enter your name / or any random drawing with your mouse on the window. 
output: musical tones based on how the drawing interacts with the 'special box' that takes in points and converts them into musical sounds.
