## JS Project

I am currently deciding to choose one of the following topics that I have in mind: 

### (1) 
+  Illustrate the relationship between Crime level and Income per capita, Unemployment rate, and Education. (could add/remove params like education)
    - I have worked with crime stats before so the data is available at borough level for NYC. 

### (2) 
+  Time series analysis between Health issues (like obesity) and Fast Food Stores / Income (per capita.)
    - I have to take a look at the data for Fast Food stores. This one is interesting but I am not quite sure if the data is available in a format that would be useful (i.e. whether data is annual, etc)

<!-- ### (3)
+  This one is freestyling but I was thinking about a web app that has basic i/o. 
    - *input*: food item
    - *output*: nutritional props/cons
    - the ability to compare several foods and be able to pick the one with less harmful content.

+  But I think the overall idea, visually, could be less stylish and therefore not attractive. For some reason, it also feels less challenging. -->

<!-- ### (4)

+  This one is also kind of freestyling and moving away from data visualization but the general idea: 
    - *input*: Enter your name / or any random drawing with your mouse on the window. 
    - *output*: musical tones based on how the drawing interacts with the 'special box' that takes in points and converts them into musical sounds. -->

### (5)

+ A Search Engine from scratch

(If allowed, this would be my ideal selection)

I had this idea that we had to use JS to build our project.
Hence, I was looking forward to building a basic search engine since
I seem to be really interested into figuring out how it works [bts]. So I spent 
some time reading about 'crawling' and efficient ways to send request to database, etc. 
But I am guessing this is not allowed anymore since it's not really data visualization 
or game to the extent shown in the syllabus?

<!-- ### (6)

+ Browser History (Visuals)
    - Given Browser History content, illustrate where user spends time (Pie chart)?
    - This one seems really interesting. 
    - But it seems too personal.
    - Seems less challenging. Not sure. -->

(7) Replicate "What Percent Are You?"
